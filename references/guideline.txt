Create a program that allows the analysis of any type of file with information that is provided (the files will be in .csv, excel and word format for now). Once the files are loaded, the system must train a machine learning model to analyze, but above all "learn" from the grafted data. Once the model has enough information, it must be able to respond logically and reasonably to the questions that are asked about the information provided.
As an example, the system should act similar to ChatGPT. Data is ingested into a model and the user can ask analytical questions about the information that was processed by the model.
